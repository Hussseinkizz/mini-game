# ðŸ¤“ Z Whack A Mole

A just for fun little mini game made with z js inspired by [Kenny Yip Coding's Whack a Mole Game in Javascript HTML CSS](https://youtu.be/ej8SatOj3V4) with added features, sound effects, and extra ergonomics!

The boilerplate was created using [create-z-project](https://github.com/Z-Js-Framework/create-z-project), a quick way to start building with z, with recommended project structure and example patterns.

ðŸ’¡ For full documentation on z js, see [Z Js Framework Docs](https://github.com/javaScriptKampala/z-js)

## Having It Running

you don't need a lot, just clone this repo, then get any http server and run it from the root or index.html, that's it... or just `npm i -g vite` and in root of the project run `vite dev` that's it.
